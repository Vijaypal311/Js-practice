// All about loops in JavaSript.

/*1 . for loop : A for loop repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false. The JavaScript for loop is similar to the Java and C for loop.*/\

Example : 

for (initialization; condition; afterthought)
    statement

/*2 . do while loop : The do...while statement repeats until a specified condition evaluates to false.*/

Example : 

do
  statement
while (condition);

/*3. while loop : A while statement executes its statements as long as a specified condition evaluates to true.If the condition becomes false, statement within the loop stops executing and control passes to the statement following the loop.*/

Example :

while (condition)
    statement

/* 

// Label, break and Continue Statements.

Label : A label provides a statement with an identifier that lets you refer to it elsewhere in your program. For example, you can use a label to identify a loop, and then use the break or continue statements to indicate whether a program should interrupt the loop or continue its execution.

break : Use the break statement to terminate a loop, switch, or in conjunction with a labeled statement.

Continue : The continue statement can be used to restart a while, do-while, for, or label statement.
